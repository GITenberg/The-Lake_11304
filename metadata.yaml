description: Father Gogarty's changing perceptions of the landscape he encounters
  during his frequent walks around a lake in a remote area of Ireland lead him to
  question some fundamental principles of the Catholic Church and to come to a more
  instinctive relationship with God. The afterword discusses Moore's literary style
  and the influence of Zola, Dujardin, and his own later writing which led to two
  revisions of The Lake.
